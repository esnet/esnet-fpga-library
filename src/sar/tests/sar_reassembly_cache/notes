FORWARD SEGMENT TABLE
- key: bufID, offset
- value: frame_ptr

REVERSE SEGMENT TABLE
- key: bufID, lastOffset
- value: frame_ptr

FRAME RECORDS
- state: bufId, start_address, next_address, num_segments, timer

Look up offset of new segment in forward segment table
Look up offset of new segment in reverse segment table

One of four outcomes:
  - find forward entry, no reverse entry
    - append to existing segment
    - create new forward entry
    - delete previous forward entry

  - find reverse entry, no forward entry
    - prepend to existing segment
    - create new reverse entry
    - delete previous reverse segment

  - find neither entry
    - first segment or isolated segment
    - create new segment
    - create new forward entry
    - create new reverse entry (only if offset > 0?)

  - find both entries
    - 'missing' piece
    - concatentate segments
    - delete previous forward entry
    - delete previous delete entry

Poll segments:
    - look for monolithic segments containing entries from 0 to TOTAL_LEN (per buffer)
      - when found:
        - report full buffer
        - remove segment
        - remove forward segment table entry
        - remove reverse segment table entry
    - look for expired segments
      - remove segment
      - remove forward segment table entry
      - remove reverse segment table entry
