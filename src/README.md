axi4l/  - Contains components that implement standard AXI4-Lite logic, including a controller,
          decoder and interface (typically used to implement register map control logic).

axi4s/  - Contains components that implement standard AXI4-Stream logic, including a fifo, probe
          and interface, as well as other miscellanous functions (typically used to implement
	  packet-based datapath logic).

crc/    - Contains components to implement CRC generation and checking logic.

fifo/   - Contains components to implement synchronous and asynchronous FPGA FIFOs of various
          sizes.

mem/    - Contains implementations of generic interfaces and modules that can be used in memory
          applications.

packet/ - Contains implementations of generic interfaces, modules and verification infrastructure
          useful for implementing and testing packet applications.

reg/    - Contains components for implementing registers and register access.

          A primary function of this library is to provide the underlying logic for regmap components
	  that get autogenerated by the regio tool. The autogeneration templates in regio contain
	  references to modules that are maintained within the 'reg' RTL library.

          Also included in the library are verification components that can be leveraged
          in any testbench requiring standard (i.e. regio) register access.

std/    - Contains a collection of standard (common) modules/classes/packages/interfaces for use
          in design and verification.

sync/   - Contains a library of components that can be used for synchronization and clock-domain
          crossing (CDC) functions.  

util/   - Contains a collection of standard *utility* modules/classes/packages/interfaces for use in
          design and verification.
